US-Challenge-01 — Learner improves secure coding skills through fixing a real vulnerability

As a beginner software engineer using Codesafe,
I want to complete a hands-on challenge that exposes a real security flaw in a login system,
So that I can learn how insecure comparison logic leads to timing attacks and understand how to patch such vulnerabilities in real software.
lnerabilities in real software.

Explanation of educational value

This challenge teaches learners a fundamental secure-coding concept: implementing constant-time comparisons to prevent timing attacks in authentication logic. By working with a simplified but realistic login system, learners can clearly observe how small implementation details, such as early returns in string comparison, can introduce serious security risks.

The challenge directly supports the goals and vision of the Codesafe platform by reinforcing practical security skills through a scenario-based task (VIS-02), supporting learner progress through hands-on practice and verification via test cases (G-01), and exposing learners to an authentic vulnerability that reflects issues found in real-world systems. Overall, the challenge helps bridge the gap between theoretical security concepts and real software engineering practice.
