US-Challenge-01 — Learner improves secure coding skills through fixing a real vulnerability

As a beginner software engineer using Codesafe,
I want to complete a hands-on challenge that exposes a real security flaw in a login system,
so that I can learn how insecure comparison logic leads to timing attacks and understand how to patch such vulnerabilities in real software.

Explanation of educational value

This challenge teaches learners a fundamental secure-coding concept: constant-time comparisons.
It connects directly to Codesafe’s goals by:

reinforcing practical security skills through scenario-based tasks (VIS-02)

supporting learning progress and providing meaningful feedback (G-01)

showing an authentic vulnerability found in real systems (platform mission)

The task is moderately difficult and expected to take 30–60 minutes, providing meaningful practice without overwhelming new learners.
